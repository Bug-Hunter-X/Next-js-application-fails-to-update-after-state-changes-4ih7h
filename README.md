# Next.js Application Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js application where the UI fails to update after state changes. The application renders correctly on initial load but does not reflect changes made to the application state.

## Bug Description

The application renders a simple 'Hello, world!' message.  Despite attempts to update the state, the UI remains unchanged, indicating a failure in the state management or rendering process.  This issue causes an inconsistent and unpredictable user experience.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the UI does not update when state is modified. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the state change triggers a re-render of the component by using the useState hook correctly.  The provided solution demonstrates how to properly use the hook. This ensures that the UI updates to reflect the latest state.
